# How to Use the Code Snippets Chrome Extension

## Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. **Download the Code Base**
   - First, download the code base for the extension from the repository or provided source.

### 2. **Extract the Downloaded File**
   - Once you've downloaded the file, unzip it to a folder on your computer. This folder will contain all the necessary files to run the extension.

### 3. **Open Chrome Extensions Page**
   - Open Google Chrome and go to the Extensions page by typing `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar and pressing **Enter**.
   
### 4. **Enable Developer Mode**
   - On the Extensions page, you'll see a switch at the top right that says **Developer mode**. Toggle this switch to enable it. This mode allows you to install extensions manually without going through the Chrome Web Store.

### 5. **Load Unpacked Extension**
   - Once Developer Mode is enabled, you will see new options: **Load unpacked**, **Pack extension**, and **Update**.
   - Click on the **Load unpacked** button. This will allow you to load the extracted folder as a Chrome extension.

### 6. **Select the `dist` Folder**
   - In the dialog that appears, navigate to the folder you unzipped earlier.
   - Select the `dist` folder inside it. This folder contains the final build of the extension, ready to be loaded into Chrome.
   - Click **Select Folder** (or **Open** depending on your system). Your extension will now be installed.
